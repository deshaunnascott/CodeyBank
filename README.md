# CodeyBank
Personal project to practice database and GUI development with Python. It is intended to mock the
basic operations of a bank account owner.

## Table of Contents
* [Current Feature](#CurrentFeatures)
* [Dependencies](#Dependencies)
* [Setup](#LocalStep)
* [Extra Information](#ExtraInformation)
* [ToDo](#ToDo)

## CurrentFeatures
    * Withdrawal
    * Deposit
    * View Account Details

These are the basic features I started with. I want to add more account features in the future
such as Amount Transfer between account existing in the database

## Dependencies

    random
    tkinter

## LocalStep
1) Navigate to your local CodeyBank project folder

2) Run Main Driver File

		python CBPortal.py

## ExtraInformation
Something to note about these accounts is that they currently allow for the user to overdrawn their account.
So it is possible for an account to have a negative balance.

## ToDo
* Add new account features (i.e. Amount Transfer)
* Add more error checking
* Add a sample database
